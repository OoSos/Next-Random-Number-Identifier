## Recommendations

1. **Import Order**: Follow PEP 8 - stdlib, third-party, local
2. **Absolute Imports**: Use `from src.module import Class` instead of relative imports
3. **Remove sys.path**: Avoid `sys.path.insert()` in favor of proper package structure
4. **Group Comments**: Add section comments for better organization
