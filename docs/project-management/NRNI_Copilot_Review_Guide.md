## Specific Issues to Investigate

### Critical Items (Address Immediately)
1. **Import Pattern Inconsistencies**: Mixed relative/absolute imports across modules
2. **Optional Dependency Handling**: XGBoost import handling in ensemble.py
3. **Error Message Standardization**: Consistent error reporting across components
4. **Performance Bottlenecks**: Feature engineering optimization opportunities

### High Priority Items
1. **Type Hint Completeness**: Ensure all public APIs have complete type hints
2. **Documentation Gaps**: Missing or incomplete docstrings
3. **Test Coverage Gaps**: Areas with insufficient test coverage
4. **Memory Usage**: Large dataset handling optimization

### Medium Priority Items
1. **Code Duplication**: Repeated patterns that could be refactored
2. **Configuration Validation**: Improved parameter validation
3. **Logging Consistency**: Standardized logging across modules
4. **CLI User Experience**: Enhanced error messages and help text
